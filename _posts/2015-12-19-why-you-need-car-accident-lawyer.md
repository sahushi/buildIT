Being in a car accident can be very stressful and prevent you from thinking straight. The best option for you is to hire a car accident lawyer.
The problem here is not who is going to pay for the car’s damage, because that will be taken care by the insurance company. The problem lays in the accusations of being guilty about the accident.
That’s where the lawyer comes in handy. 
What should you do if you find yourself in a car accident?
The first phone call you should make is to the ambulance – if somebody is hurt. Next you should immediately call your car accident lawyer.
