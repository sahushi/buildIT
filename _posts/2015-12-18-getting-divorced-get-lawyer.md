title:  "Getting divorced? – Get a Lawyer."
---

Unlike marriage which is done in a church, divorce is executed in court.

These days’ divorce numbers are going pretty high compared to previous years. The statistics show that 5-10 couples of 1000 get divorced.
A divorce lawyer can help you in planning the divorce by going through proper state procedures. He can give you legal advice for topics like Child custody, Child support and proper division.
You should choose a lawyer based on his experience. Searching online will provide you with many lawyers. That of course is not guaranteed that he is a good lawyer with good experience. We recommend finding a lawyer online by looking through their case history. How many wins has he had and how many loses? 

Also look for referrals. Good referrals are extremely important when choosing your lawyer.
All that matters at the end is that getting divorced should not affect your life in a negative way and you should start thinking forward and move on with your life without stress.
