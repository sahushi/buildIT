As we get older we start taking life insurance more seriously. Life insurance starts when we are younger. The younger you are the cheaper life insurance gets. Here is a list of what to do to ensure a long life:
1.	Donâ€™t smoke (Quit smoking if you already do)
2.	Exercise at least twice a week
3.	Keep your body weight, blood sugar, blood pressure normal
4.	Avoid stressful situations
5.	Take medications as prescribed

You should already know that if you are working as an employee then you are already contributing to your life insurance part of your salary.

The cost of life insurance is based on your rating. Here are the main things:
*	Age: The older you are, the more you will pay for your life insurance.
*	Health History: Based on your medical history records
*	Lifestyre: This basically has to do with the way you choose to live your life for example dangerous hobbies you do like skydiving or scuba diving

It may sometimes be cheaper for people over 50 to find permanent life insurance. And it may be a better option if you want life insurance for your whole life. Permanent life insurance comes in many forms:
Whole life: Whole life placed a lot of the financial risk on the insurance company and so this type is less available now. A disadvantage of whole life is that the costs for administration were not transparent.

Universal life: This type of insurance has generally replaced most Whole Life policies. Some Universal Life policies build cash value, but others like Guaranteed Premium Universal Life do not. Universal Life Insurance has some advantages over Whole Life Insurance even though it is more expensive. Here are the advantages:
*	Paying Estate taxes.
*	Taking Care of children special needs.
*	Providing for needs for a family business.
*	Allows for maximizing retirement income by using life insurance to provide for spouse rather than taking a 2/3 spouse retirement benefit.

Where to find Life Insurance Companies?
The best options is to make a Google Search because chances are that you will get local results and then filter for the best company. Another method is to use Insurance Company Agents. This basically means you will contact somebody to guide you through te process.

There are also Independent Life Insurance Agents. These types of agents work with many companies rather than just one. You might find a cheaper solution with these agents.

Life Insurance is extremely important and we hope you make the right choise.
